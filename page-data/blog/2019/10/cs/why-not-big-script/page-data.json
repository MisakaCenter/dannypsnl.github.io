When it in a thousand lines script?</p>\n<p>Last time I see the code is for a build process at 500+ lines later.</p>\n<p>Why happened? In any programming language, put a variable close to its usage is a vital thing. WHY WE DONT DO THAT IN THE SCRIPT?</p>\n<p>And sometimes, remove somethings from a script is hard. Sorry, I'm lying; that's always hard.</p>\n<p>Because we even do not know why that code exists.</p>\n<p>Okay, I know we can write comments. However, every month, I can find something already outdated in our script. Although we cared about that content is outdated or not. But it still happened.</p>\n<p>So we can't remove them so comfortable.</p>\n<p>A script leads to a complex combination of commands. Everyone write complicated command chain. I think everyone knows; the code can't show the whole line on the screen; it is hard to read. When it with a complex text converting trick, damn.</p>\n<p>We already know a big script is: not understandable, hard to debug, can't read.</p>\n<p>Well, what can we do?</p>\n<p>BEST: We do not write a big script!</p>\n<p>But, if already there?</p>\n<p>We have to try to reduce it. Replace the shell script with any other mainstream languages is a good idea because they have a better design than the shell script. Trying to use an excellent cross-platform build system and always invoke it is also one way, and they usually have a nice DSL or Python :).</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Don't write a big script</li>\n<li>If already have one, try to use others tool to replace it</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Why not a big script","categories":["cs"],"tags":["shell"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2019/10/cs/why-not-big-script/"}}}
