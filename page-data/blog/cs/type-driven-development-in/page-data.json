Because we need some meta to make sure we are adding correctness Matrix together.\nWe don't want something like <code>[0 0] + [1 0 3]</code> can work, because Matrix can't be that.\nSo what will we do at first? Every programmer will check it(I thought, hope I am correct). And most of them will check it at: runtime. But runtime checking is danger. If I could, I always trying compile-time checking, because the chance that can be find out by editor is very big, almost 100%. But how to do that?</p>\n<p>In C++, template help we checking at compile-time.\nAnd almost no other language can template integer as template parameter. In Java, we have generic only. And a lot language only have generic too.\nBut maybe some people can't understand <code>Idris</code>, so let's use <code>C++</code>.</p>\n<p>The point is: when we need Matrix add. Only those Matrix with correct X, Y can add together.\nWith template check, second Add always can't pass compile.\nHope you already got the point of TDD.\nThat is define type for certain usage, you can get the help from Type System.\nIt can limit error into a narrow part.\nThanks for read.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Type driven development in C++"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/cs/type-driven-development-in/"}}}
