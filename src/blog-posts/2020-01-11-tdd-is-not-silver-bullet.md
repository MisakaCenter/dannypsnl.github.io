For the decade, people like to say TDD can solve problems faster, and I'm going to claim this was not the truth. We could solve the problem was because we knew the solution. TDD was good, but no silver bullet. We could say that TDD helping us find out the misc bug when developing them faster, but TDD was not able to find a deeper problem: the design/architecture problem.

We could have thousands of tests but cannot believe their results, and this was because we didn't understand our problems, so when we had a test failed, we cannot make sure the problem was a specification error or coding error. Humans, not tests, solved the problem. I hope this could save you from the crazy TDD believer or stop being a crazy TDD believer.
