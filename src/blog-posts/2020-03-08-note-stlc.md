Last time I introduce [lambda calculus](/blog/2020/01/01/cs/note-what-is-lambda-calculus/).
Lambda calculus is powerful enough for computation. But it's not good enough for people, compare with below **Church Numerals**

$$
add := \lambda m. \lambda n. \lambda s. \lambda z. m\;s\;(n\;s\;z)
$$

people prefer just `+` more.

But once we introduce such fundamental operations into the system, validation would be a thing. This is the main reason to have a $$\lambda \to$$ system(a.k.a. simply typed lambda calculus). It gets name $$\lambda \to$$ is because it introduces one new type: Arrow type, represent as $$T_1 \to T_2$$ for any abstraction $$\lambda x.M$$ where $$x$$ has a type is $$T_1$$ and $$M$$ has a type is $$T_2$$. Therefore we can limit the input to a specified type, without considering how to add two `Car` together!

To represent this, syntax needs a little change:

```bnf
term ::=                                                     terms
  x                                                           variable
  Î»x: T.term                                     abstraction
  term term                                     application
```

Abstraction now can describe it's parameter type. Then we have typing rules:

$$
\frac{
  x:T \in \Gamma
  }{
  \Gamma \vdash x:T
  } \;\;\;\; T-Variable
\\
\frac{
  \Gamma, x:T_1 \vdash t_2: T_2
  }{
  \Gamma \vdash \lambda x:T_1.t_2 : T_1 \to T_2
  } \;\;\;\; T-Abstraction
\\
\frac{
  \Gamma, t_1:T_1 \to T_2 \; \Gamma \vdash t_2: T_1
  }{
  \Gamma \vdash t_1 \; t_2 : T_2
  } \;\;\;\; T-Application
$$

Here is explaination:

- T-Variable: with the premise, term $$x$$ binds to type $$T$$ in context $$\Gamma$$ is truth. We can make a conclusion, in context $$\Gamma$$, we can judge the type of $$x$$ is $$T$$.
- T-Abstraction: with the premise, with context $$\Gamma$$ and term $$x$$ binds to type $$T_1$$ we can judge term $$t_2$$ has type $$T_2$$. We can make a conclusion, in context $$\Gamma$$, we can judge the type of $$\lambda x:T_1.t_2$$ is $$T_1 \to T_2$$.
- T-Application: with the premise, with context $$\Gamma$$ and term $$t_1$$ binds to type $$T_1 \to T_2$$ and with context $$\Gamma$$ we can judge term $$t_2$$ has type $$T_1$$. We can make a conclusion, in context $$\Gamma$$, we can judge the type of $$t_1 \; t_2$$ is $$T_2$$.
